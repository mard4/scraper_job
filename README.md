## Introduction
Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. In this project, we leverage web scraping techniques to gather job data from Indeed, a popular job listing website, and content from Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia. The collected data can then be used for various purposes such as analysis, visualization, or research.

## Setup
To use this tool, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Beautiful Soup (`beautifulsoup4`)
- Requests (`requests`)

You can install the required packages by running the following command:
```
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
```

## Indeed Scraper
The Indeed scraper is designed to extract job postings from Indeed based on specific search criteria. It uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML structure of the search results page and retrieves relevant job details such as title, company, location, salary, and job description. The scraper supports pagination, allowing you to retrieve multiple pages of results.

## Wikipedia Scraper
The Wikipedia scraper allows you to extract content from Wikipedia articles. It utilizes the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML structure of a Wikipedia page and retrieve the main content. The scraper is capable of handling different types of pages, such as articles, biographies, or historical events.

## Analysis
After collecting data from Indeed and Wikipedia, you can perform various analyses on the obtained information. Here are a few examples of potential analyses:

1. Job market trends: Analyze the scraped job data from Indeed to identify trends in specific industries, job titles, or locations.
2. Salary comparison: Compare salaries across different job postings to gain insights into salary ranges and variations.
3. Natural language processing: Apply text analysis techniques to job descriptions or Wikipedia content to extract keywords, perform sentiment analysis, or identify patterns.

Feel free to explore additional analysis possibilities based on your specific requirements and interests.

## Usage
To use the web scraping and analysis tool, follow these steps:

1. Configure the search parameters for the Indeed scraper, such as the job title and location.
2. Run the Indeed scraper to collect job data from Indeed.
3. Provide a Wikipedia URL to scrape content from a specific Wikipedia page.
4. Perform analysis on the obtained data using your preferred analysis techniques.

Make sure to handle the scraped data responsibly and respect the terms of service of the websites you are scraping.
